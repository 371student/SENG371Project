# SENG371Project
# Project Question:
* How is the growth of a software project affected by coupling? Is it possible to analyze/visualize coupling in a software project?

# Methodology:
* Analyse multiple Git repositories by looking at the commits by each developer, and classify the project on a scale of     tightly-clustered vs. widely-spread clustering. Further analyse each project in terms of patches of legacy code (Gource), coupling (Snakefood), project activity (Gource), downloads (Github), and whether or not the project was abandoned (Github).

# Codebase / Systems
* We would analyze 3 codebases with our tool.
<br /> 1) Django
<br /> 2) Pyramid
<br /> 3) Flask

# Project Milestones
* Below are the milestones for our project. Milestone 3 is ideal; however, may not be possible.
<br /> 1) Run Snakefood on individual commits first to see how a video of these pictures would look
<br /> 2) Create a script to automatically retrieve all the snakefood images for a repo, then run Gource
<br /> 3) Ideally merge files into a video and run in sync with the Gource video
