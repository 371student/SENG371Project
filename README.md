# SENG371Project
# Project Question:
* How is the growth of a software project affected by coupling? Is it possible to analyze/visualize coupling in a software project?

#Methodology:
* Analyse multiple Git repositories by looking at the commits by each developer, and classify the project on a scale of     tightly-clustered vs. widely-spread clustering. Further analyse each project in terms of patches of legacy code (Gource), coupling (Snakefood), project activity (Gource), downloads (Github), and whether or not the project was abandoned (Github).
